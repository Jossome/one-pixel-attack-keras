# Disguise Attack
An extreme attack base on the paper "One pixel attack for fooling deep neural networks".

## Demo


## What's new?
- Objective:
    $$ L = e^{\gamma(C-1)} + \Delta $$





## TODO
- [x] Run on cifar10.
- [x] Run on basic leNet and ResNet.
- [ ] Regulation on delta.
- [ ] Run on more models.
- [ ] Run on imageNet.
